  I help business owners to unlock their brand’s potential, focusing on guiding
  progressive, visionary entrepreneurs in their (re)branding journeys. For each
  project, I bring together the best possible team from my global network of
  talented professionals – thus giving my clients an agile, budget-friendly
  solution. I always ask 3 times ‘why’ and never shy away from big challenges. I
  was trained as an industrial designer (1987 – Design Academy Eindhoven, the
  Netherlands) and learned about brand design and brand strategy while working
  at BRS Premsela Vonk and Eden Design & Communication – leading design
  consultancies in the Netherlands in the 90’s and 00’s. Before starting Just
  Edo in 2020, I was co-founder and creative director at global design
  consultancy Edenspiekermann (Amsterdam, Berlin, Los Angeles, Singapore). As
  guest lecturer at various design schools and universities in Europe and Asia,
  I share my knowledge and experience with talented and upcoming professionals
  in the design field.
