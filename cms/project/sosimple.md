f_introduction: >-
  We all need energy. Our economy, our wellbeing and our livelihood depend on
  it. But most energy is expensive and dirty; cheap, clean energy is still very
  difficult to get. Sosimple leads the shift to clean energy and helps to save
  companies money, by selling them clean power in an effortless and hassle-free
  way. SoSimple helps improve the world we live in, one roof at a time.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  JustEdo was asked to create the brand identity for Sosimple. We wanted to make
  their ambition and vision tangible and set them apart from their competitors
  in South Africa, where they started their business towards the end of 2018.
  The name Sosimple was already chosen by the company’s core team when we
  started. It’s a good name, but it didn’t convey that it’s an energy company
  nor indicate that it’s a proposition for businesses, or suggest a price point.
  To solve this, we created an additional “cover-all” tagline: ‘Cheap energy.
  Clean business.’
f_paragraph-2: >-
  The new logo is based on a simple idea: the energy shift. A circle is split
  into two parts and these two parts are shifted so that together they form the
  letter ‘S’. Sosimple’s colour palette is based on sun (yellow), water and sky
  (blue) and biomass (green); the main sources of alternative energy.
