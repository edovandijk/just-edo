f_introduction: >-
  Moving beyond the space of building and supporting coworking communities,
  Found. is a network of innovation studios where ambitious entrepreneurs and
  corporates find coaching, expertise, and partners to create future-ready
  solutions.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  JustEdo’s predecessor Edenspiekermann Singapore developed the brand strategy,
  name, logo and visual identity for the new brand, in line with the company’s
  decision to leave the global Impact Hub network and to fulfil their desire to
  further scale their operations and reach into Southeast Asia.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  The name ‘Found.’ signals both a journey and a goal. More importantly, it is a
  place of belonging, whichever part of the journey one is on. The logo was
  founded on the idea of connecting the dots. Two inverse dots – inside the ’o’
  and the ‘d’ – are complemented by two solid dots of the same size – inside the
  ‘F’ and the full stop. On and off; yin and yang; lost and found. The full stop
  at the end grounds the journey of the Found.ers — this is where they belong.
f_testimonial: >-
  « Our new brand needed to capture the essence of being part of our community –
  of courage, collaboration, and a fierce passion for creating change in the
  world. We feel that Edo and his team have successfully captured that and more.
