f_paragraph-1: >-
  To enrich the literary experience of the students and to encourage them to
  read more and better books, Tanglin Trust School’s library department and
  JustEdo’s predecessor, Edenspiekermann Singapore, developed a microsite and a
  large scale poster helping students to discover new book titles based on
  selected topics or related book titles and authors. The reading lists are
  styled like a subway line network in an imaginary city. Each station
  represents a particular book to be read, while each subway line represents a
  particular grouping of books (often belonging to the same genre).
  Intersections of lines imply that the book belongs to more than one reading
  list.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  The geography of the subway diagram is loosely based off the actual diagram of
  the Singapore subway system.
f_subtitle: Inspirational guide for high school students
f_title: Tanglin Reading Express
