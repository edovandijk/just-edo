f_introduction: >-
  Nikoi and Cempedak are two sustainable private island resorts off the coast of
  Bintan, Indonesia, owned by a small group of investor friends who share a
  passion for the outdoors, nature, food and wine.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  The inspiration to develop Nikoi & Cempedak into private island retreats had
  its roots in disenchantment with the standards of holiday accommodations on
  offer, within easy reach of Singapore. The choices were either flea-ridden
  shacks or opulently garish five-star hotels; cultural sensitivity, vernacular
  design and simple luxuries were seemingly unheard of. With that in mind, the
  concept of Nikoi came to life in 2007, quickly becoming a popular destination
  for Singapore residents and visitors from farther away. Many guests are
  regular returnees, making this idyllic island their preferred escape from busy
  city life.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  From the outset, building and operating Nikoi & Cempedak along strict
  sustainable principles has been at the forefront of development plans for the
  islands. Not only were the resorts built entirely with local materials, labour
  and services but they are also operated by the local community. Cempedak
  Island – opened in 2017 – is the world’s first private island resort to be
  constructed entirely from bamboo. Through time, many important trades and
  skills have been transferred to the islands’ contractors and staff.
f_paragraph-3: >-
  We designed and built the new websites for Nikoi & Cempedak, bringing the
  relaxed and personal island retreat experience to life in the browser. In
  addition to the default English language version of the site, we helped to
  bring a Japanese language version online, supporting the rapidly growing
  interest for the islands from this Asian nation.

  « We started out by putting a couple of shacks on the beach, before deciding
  to open it up on weekends just to cover the cost. We weren’t focused on making
  it a business but it became very popular. »
