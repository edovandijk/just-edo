f_introduction: >-
  Aspial is a family-owned conglomerate with diverse business operations in
  jewellery retail, real estate, financial services, hospitality, and precious
  metal trading. Aspial asked us to help them redefine their corporate brand
  after we successfully helped them create a new brand for their precious metals
  division, Goldheart Bullion.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  We started the rebranding process with redefining Aspial’s brand profile based
  on a series of interviews with board members and various key employees from
  its subsidiaries Goldheart, Lee Hwa Jewellery, World Class Global, and Maxi
  Cash.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  Building upon the company’s perceived aspirations and strengths, and
  sharpening the personality traits which Aspial wanted to grow, we created a
  new corporate identity which aims to be progressive, trustworthy and
  human-centred for its staff; and trustworthy, confident and inspiring for
  Aspial’s business relations. The new identity was launched together with the
  opening of Aspial One, the new company HQ, for which we also designed the
  facade signage and wayfinding.
