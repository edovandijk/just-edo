f_introduction: >-
  After some serious issues with mail deliveries in the second half of 2018,
  Singapore Post launched a nationwide campaign called MyPostman in the course
  of 2019. The programme provides residents an additional channel to connect
  with SingPost in the event of a postal service issue. It also provides a
  platform for Singapore residents to identify and show appreciation for their
  friendly neighbourhood postman.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  As part of the campaign and website which we developed for Singapore Post,
  almost 2 million sets of fridge magnets with QR-codes were distributed to
  every residential household and business unit across Singapore. Residents can
  access the website and key in their postal code to find out who is the postman
  serving their area. In addition, residents can also provide feedback, words of
  encouragement or rate the service they have received.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  Public response to MyPostman has been extremely encouraging; residents are now
  approaching their postmen by name with words of appreciation, providing a
  much-needed morale boost and serving as a reminder that their work does not go
  unnoticed.
f_testimonial: >-
  « What we hope this campaign does is to foster a spirit of community and to
  encourage residents to get to know their postman who provides this essential
  service, rain or shine. »
