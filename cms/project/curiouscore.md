f_introduction: >-
  CuriousCore believes that continuous learning in a flexible and scalable
  manner is key to personal and professional empowerment in an ever-evolving,
  technology driven world. This is why they are building one of the most
  impactful education institutions for the technology industry outside of
  Silicon Valley.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  CuriousCore asked JustEdo to help strengthen their regional positioning and
  brand awareness in Southeast Asia by revamping their brand profile and brand
  identity. We designed their new dynamic logo to epitomise a lust for learning,
  with bright orange circles representing the inquisitive spirit that guides
  students and organisations through the journey of growing their careers and
  business.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  JustEdo also developed their core identity principles and a host of example
  applications as shown here. CuriousCore’s in-house designer used our Brand
  Guidebook to create many additional applications, such as programme brochures,
  certificates, course guides, and marketing tools, including social media
  banners and ads.
f_testimonial: >-
  « We’re grateful that the JustEdo team had a disciplined process in getting us
  to start with the ‘why’ first before establishing our brand pillars. This made
  it easier for our marketing team to do brand building moving forward. »
