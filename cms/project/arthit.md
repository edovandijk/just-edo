f_introduction: >-
  Anneke Verschuren – founder and CEO of ArtHit – had the ambition to build a
  global online marketplace for art, accessible for everyone. When we first
  discussed her ideas, there wasn’t much more than a name and a business plan,
  so we started with creating the brand identity first before moving on to the
  website.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  Based on the name and business concept, we explored different references and
  moods for the brand and shared them with the team during a kick-off workshop.
  It didn’t take long before a promising direction surfaced, based on a simple
  graphic of an easel which can carry canvases of different sizes and colours.
  The shape of the easel is halfway an 'A' and an 'H', referencing the capital
  letters in ArtHit. We visually explained this concept in a catchy logo
  animation.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  Once the logo and visual identity were defined, we moved on to the website
  development. For our team in Singapore, it was the first time we worked agile,
  with a mixed team of designers and developers. In the course of 6 sprints, we
  designed and built all functionalities of the ArtHit website, including a
  checkout process and a ‘view on wall’ functionality (see below) which would
  give users a better idea of the size and context of selected art works.
f_paragraph-3: >-
  Exactly 3 months after the kick-off workshop we soft-launched Arthit.com. When
  the database of paintings hit above the 300 mark – and we had solved a few
  pesky bugs – we officially launched the site to a broader audience.
f_testimonial: >-
  The team in Singapore did an excellent job in designing and developing the
  branding and website for ArtHit. We are very happy with and proud of the logo,
  the brand identity and most of all the website. And maybe even more important
  is the great cooperation during the whole process from the start till the end.
  I cannot say anything else other than this team is a truly kick-ass agile team
  that I would recommend anytime!
