f_introduction: >-
  Ravel designs and implements corporate-startup innovation programs for
  progressive organisations. By combining organisational psychology,
  startup-driven methodologies, and a network of global startup talent and
  technologies, Ravel creates real impact for their clients, who in turn, go on
  to change the world.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  Ravel is an evolution from Impact Hub Singapore, to its mature ecosystem of
  innovators at Found8. After the spin-out to solely focus on corporate
  innovation, Ravel combines the best of two worlds – technology and impact. 
f_paragraph-2: >-
  JustEdo helped F8 Innovation to find a new brand positioning and coined the
  name ‘Ravel’; a contronym which means both ‘tangling’ and ‘untangling’. We
  recognised that innovation needs both – and chaos before order – to create
  sustained and meaningful impact; making Ravel the perfect name for the new
  entity. In the brand identity, the duality of ravelling-unravelling was our
  source of inspiration for both the symbol and the logo mark.
f_testimonial: >-
  « We chose the name ‘Ravel’ because it is a word that contains opposite
  meanings – tangle and untangle – and we felt that it sums up the innovation
  journey in one word. There’s hardly any order without chaos, clarity without
  confusion. We understand that and we embrace both equally. We are thankful to
  have worked again with Edo and his team to successfully bring this new brand
  to life. »
