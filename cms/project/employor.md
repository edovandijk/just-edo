f_introduction: >-
  Employor is an employer of record (EOR) and a professional employer
  organisation (PEO) all rolled into one. Their payroll and HR services help
  international companies operating in the Netherlands by unravelling the
  complexities and administration that accompany cross-border hiring.
f_paragraph-1: >-
  Employor is part of the Broadstreet Group – a Dutch company with 25 years of
  expertise in tax, payroll and financial services for international companies.
  When Broadstreet decided to further develop their payroll services into an
  independent business, they approached JustEdo to help with the development of
  a new brand identity and various communication tools, including their new
  website.
f_paragraph-2: >-
  The brand concept is a simple check mark, nestled inside the letter ‘y’ in the
  logo. It symbolises the role that Employor undertakes in making the onboarding
  process of new employees in the Netherlands smooth and worry-free for
  employers. The patterns used in the background reflect the often intricate and
  lengthy processes involved in the onboarding.
f_paragraph-3: >-
  JustEdo designed and built Employor’s website to be the primary point of entry
  for Employor’s global clients, who are seeking guidance and support with a
  fast entry into the Dutch labour market.
