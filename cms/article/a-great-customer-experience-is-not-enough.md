title: A great customer experience is not enough
f_intro-text: >-
  Customer experience design is crucial for any company’s success. Well-designed
  services enhance the customer experience and lead to increased customer
  satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business. A positive customer experience can
  also lead to favourable word-of-mouth, as satisfied customers are more likely
  to recommend the company or its brand to others. But it’s not enough.

  ### Make an Emotional Connection


  Finally, brand identity design can help to create an emotional connection with
  customers. To create an emotional connection, a brand should focus on
  understanding its customers’ needs, values, and preferences. Brands can create
  emotional connections by telling stories that evoke positive emotions,
  delivering on their promises, and supporting social causes that align with
  their customers’ beliefs. By building trust and establishing a strong
  emotional connection, a brand can foster brand loyalty and establish a lasting
  relationship with its customers.


  ##### Harley-Davidson


  One example of a brand from the USA that has a strong emotional connection
  with its customers is Harley-Davidson. Harley-Davidson’s brand identity is
  centered around the values of freedom, rebellion, and adventure.
  Harley-Davidson’s logo, a bar and shield with the company name, is instantly
  recognizable and has become synonymous with the brand’s values of
  individuality, self-expression, and conquering the open road.
  Harley-Davidson’s emotional connection with its customers is evident in the
  brand’s sales figures, which have consistently grown over the years.
  Harley-Davidson’s customers are not just buying a motorcycle; they are buying
  into a lifestyle and a set of values that resonate with them on a deep
  emotional level.

  ##### IKEA


  A European brand that has a very different but similarly strong emotional
  connection with its customers is IKEA. IKEA’s brand identity is centered
  around the idea of affordable and accessible design for everyone. IKEA’s blue
  and yellow logo is instantly recognizable and has become synonymous with the
  brand’s values of simplicity, functionality, and sustainability. IKEA’s
  emotional connection with its customers is evident in the brand’s customer
  testimonials, which often mention the sense of community and belonging that
  comes with owning IKEA products. IKEA’s customers are not just looking for
  furniture; they seek out an entire lifestyle and set of values associated with
  the brand.

  Both Harley-Davidson and IKEA have built strong emotional connections with
  their customers through their brand identity and carefully crafted brand
  personality. Harley-Davidson’s brand identity is centered around the values of
  freedom, rebellion, and adventure, while IKEA’s brand identity is centered
  around the values of simplicity, functionality, and sustainability. Both
  brands have created a sense of community and belonging among their customers,
  which has led to increased loyalty and repeat business.

  When two competing products or services offer the same functional benefits, it
  is the emotional connection that customers make with the brand – and not its
  features or functionality – that will inspire preference and loyalty.

  ### Concluding


  The brand is the cornerstone of any successful business; it can make or break
  its success with customers. A well-defined brand identity can help companies
  create a unique, memorable image in their customers’ minds that strengthens
  trust and credibility – and leads to increased loyalty.


  Businesses that invest in a unique brand identity and attractive brand
  personality are more likely to succeed in today’s highly competitive market,
  as they can better differentiate themselves from their strongest competitors;
  competitors that have often invested just as much or even more in making their
  customer experience and service design the best it can be.

In the past decade, marketing and sales teams within leading companies have invested heavily in service design – the discipline devoted to improving customer experiences. As a result, it has become important again for brands to have a renewed focus on building their brand identity and personality. When two competing products or services offer the same functional benefits, it is the emotional connection that customers make with a brand – and not its features or functionality – that will inspire preference and loyalty.

### Unique and Memorable

Firstly, brand identity design helps to create a unique and memorable brand. In today’s world, where customers are bombarded with countless advertisements and services, it is essential for a business to stand out from the crowd. A well-designed brand identity with an attractive personality can help to differentiate a business from its competitors and make it more memorable in the minds of customers.

An example of a successful and memorable brand identity is Nike. Nike’s ‘swoosh’ logo is instantly recognizable – even without the name – and has become synonymous with the brand's values of athleticism, quality, and innovation. The logo’s simple design and association with high-profile athletes have helped to establish Nike as a leader in the athletic apparel and footwear market.

### Trustworthy and Credible

Secondly, brand identity design helps to establish trust and credibility with customers. A well-designed brand identity communicates a company’s values, mission, and personality, which can help to build a relationship of trust with customers. For example, a healthcare provider with a professional and trustworthy brand identity is more likely to attract patients than one who lacks such credibility. Similarly, a financial institution with a strong and reliable brand identity is more likely to attract customers who are looking for a trustworthy partner for their financial needs.

### Consistent and Cohesive

Thirdly, brand identity design can help to create a consistent and cohesive brand personality across all touch points. A well-designed brand identity includes a set of guidelines that dictate how the brand should be presented across all platforms, including websites, social media, advertising, and packaging. This consistency helps to create a cohesive brand experience for customers, which can lead to increased brand loyalty and recognition. For example, think of Coca-Cola’s iconic red, white, and black color scheme, which is consistently used across all of the company's product packaging and marketing materials. This consistency has helped to create a strong and recognizable brand identity for Coca-Cola, which has become one of the most valuable brands in the world.
