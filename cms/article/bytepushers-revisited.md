  ### A few topics we cover in the interviews


  This was highly dependent on the interviewee – industry, type of company, and
  role all helped to define the topics we discussed during the interview.
  However, you can expect to find content about the following topics: design
  patterns, creative coding, entrepreneurship, user experience, and future
  outlook.


  ### Why we did this


  It’s a simple win-win really; everyone gets to learn something by listening to
  these bytepushers. Anyone can grow and learn with the right resources, the
  right advice, in the right circumstances. Bytepushers give you information and
  inspiration to help you get started in the (digital) creative field.

Between October 2017 and March 2018, we interviewed a variety of digital creatives and entrepreneurs in Singapore, aiming to inspire a new generation of creatives. We chose people who push the digital envelope; we were not only interested in well-established professionals, but also in aspiring creatives who had just started their professional career.

### Our focus with bytepushers

Bytepushers targets movers & makers who operate predominantly in the digital realm. Since we got the chance to interview some local heros and creatives with an interesting story to share, we did occasionally shift away from the purely digital to include other creative realms such as furniture making, graphic design, or copywriting.
