#### What is brand experience design?

Brand experience design is the process of designing a customer’s entire journey of encounters with a brand, from the first interaction to the end of the relationship. Brand experience is ultimately how a customer feels about your brand before, during, and after their interactions with you. This impression can have lasting effects on whether or not they shop with you again and if they would recommend your brand to others 1).

The key principles of brand experience design are:

*   **Consistency:** Consistency in brand experience design ensures that every interaction with the brand is aligned with the brand’s values, personality, and promise. This means that the brand experience should be the same across all channels and touchpoints, whether it’s online or offline. Companies that get brand consistency right see an average revenue increase of 33% 2).
*   **Relevance:** Brand experience design should be relevant to the target audience and meet their needs and expectations. This means that the brand experience should be tailored to the audience’s preferences, behavior, and context 3).
*   **Emotion:** Brand experience design should evoke positive emotions and create a memorable experience for the audience. This means that the brand experience should be designed to engage the audience emotionally and leave a lasting impression 4).
*   **Coherence:** Brand experience design should have a coherent narrative that tells a story about the brand and its values. This means that the brand experience should be designed to convey a clear and consistent message that resonates with the audience.
*   **Innovation:** Brand experience design should be innovative and push the boundaries of what’s possible. This means that the brand experience should be designed to surprise and delight the audience, and create a sense of anticipation for what's next.

Brand experience design is closely related to retail design and digital product design. Retail design focuses on creating an engaging and memorable physical environment that aligns with the brand’s values and messaging. Digital product design focuses on creating a seamless and intuitive digital experience that is easy to use and aligns with the brand’s values and messaging.
