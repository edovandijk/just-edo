title: Global refugee migrations since 1975
f_intro-text: >-
  In 2021, over 83 million people were living displaced from their home due to
  war, persecution or violence. Many governments refuse asylum to refugees;
  meanwhile, long-term refugees suffer various psychological hardships, and the
  root causes of the problem – war, famine, epidemics – remain unsolved.

  ### An interactive experience


  The map starts in 1975, and with each tick of a year, the circles adjust to
  show outgoing numbers or incoming numbers. Mouse-over a circle, and you can
  see where the majority of refugees went, represented with extending lines. In
  the left margin of the map, texts appear which provide more context about what
  happened.


  Hyperakt and Ekene Ijeoma created an interactive experience that illuminates
  where and when refugees emigrate, as well as the complex stories of political,
  social and economic turmoil behind each displacement. By adding historical
  context to the shifting patterns of forced migration, the site highlights the
  impact each crisis has on people’s lives.

  ### Highlighting the essential


  Working iteratively, the makers created an interface that provided a global
  overview of refugee migrations and highlighted key information. The UI was
  kept simple, composed of three variables: a world map, an information
  dashboard with a bar chart timeline, and headlines linking to stories for each
  year.


  ### Impact and recognition


  The Refugee Project has accrued over 15 million page views since launching in
  January 2014, most of which originated at universities and high schools. It
  has been shared on Twitter to millions of viewers by global humanitarian
  organizations like UNHCR, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam International, UN Global
  Pulse and Amnesty International.


  Museums and galleries in New York, London, Los Angeles, Istanbul, and Hamburg
  have featured The Refugee Project. In 2014, The Refugee Project was awarded a
  prestigious [Malofiej International Infographic
  Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malofiej_Awards) Silver Medal in a
  competition dominated by journalism giants like The New York Times, The
  Washington Post, and The Guardian. The same year it received a Gold Medal in
  the Interactive category at the ‘[Information Is Beautiful
  Awards](https://informationisbeautiful.net/2014/information-is-beautiful-awards-2014-the-winners-2/)’
  organized by [David
  McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCandless).

### Using data visualisation to create context and insight

[The Refugee Project](https://www.therefugeeproject.org/) is a learning experience created to increase awareness about the plight of millions of people around the world who have had no choice but to flee their homes. [Hyperakt](https://www.hyperakt.com/work/the-refugee-project) and [Ekene Ijeoma](https://studioijeoma.com/) visualized migrations over time and space between 1975 and 2021. The interactive is based on [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/) data, which is naturally limited in scope, because it’s difficult to register and count undocumented migrations. There is still plenty to learn though about some major political and social events in recent history.
