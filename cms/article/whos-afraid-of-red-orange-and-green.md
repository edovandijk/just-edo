  Colour blindness – or more properly called: colour vision deficiency (CVD) –
  affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women (0.5%) in the world.
  In the USA, this means that there are approximately 14.2 million colour-blind
  people, most of whom are male. They see colours differently, something to take
  into account, for instance, when designing data visualisations.

  ### Three types of colour blindness


  ##### **Red-green colour blindness**


  The most common types of hereditary colour blindness are due to the loss or
  limited function of red cone (known as protan) or green cone (deutran)
  photopigments. This kind of colour blindness is commonly referred to as
  red-green colour blindness.


  *   **Protanomaly**: In males with protanomaly, the red cone photopigment is
  abnormal. Red, orange, and yellow appear greener and colours are not as
  bright. This condition is mild and doesn’t usually interfere with daily
  living. Protanomaly is an X-linked disorder estimated to affect 1% of males.


  *   **Protanopia**: In males with protanopia, there are no working red cone
  cells. Red appears as black. Certain shades of orange, yellow, and green all
  appear as yellow. Protanopia is an X-linked disorder that is estimated to
  affect 1% of males.

  *   **Deuteranomaly**: In males with deuteranomaly, the green cone
  photopigment is abnormal. Yellow and green appear redder and it is difficult
  to tell violet from blue. This condition is mild and doesn’t interfere with
  daily living. Deuteranomaly is the most common form of colour blindness and is
  an X-linked disorder affecting 5% of males.

  *   **Deuteranopia**: In males with deuteranopia, there are no working green
  cone cells. They tend to see reds as brownish-yellow and greens as beige.
  Deuteranopia is an X-linked disorder that affects about 1% of males.

  ##### **Blue-yellow colour blindness**


  Blue-yellow colour blindness is rarer than red-green colour blindness.
  Blue-cone (tritan) photopigments are either missing or have limited function.


  *   **Tritanomaly**: People with tritanomaly have functionally limited blue
  cone cells. Blue appears greener and it can be difficult to tell yellow and
  red from pink. Tritanomaly is extremely rare. It is a disorder affecting males
  and females equally.

  *   **Tritanopia**: People with tritanopia, also known as blue-yellow colour
  blindness, lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green and yellow appears violet
  or light grey. Tritanopia is an extremely rare disorder affecting males and
  females equally.


  ##### **Complete colour blindness**


  People with complete colour blindness (monochromacy) don’t experience color at
  all and the clearness of their vision (visual acuity) may also be affected.


  There are two types of monochromacy:


  *   **Cone monochromacy**: This rare form of colour blindness results from a
  failure of two of the three cone cell photopigments to work. There is red cone
  monochromacy, green cone monochromacy, and blue cone monochromacy. People with
  cone monochromacy have trouble distinguishing colours because the brain needs
  to compare the signals from different types of cones in order to see colour.
  When only one type of cone works, this comparison isn’t possible.

  *   **Rod monochromacy or achromatopsia**: This type of monochromacy is very
  rare and is the most severe form of colour blindness. It is present at birth.
  None of the cone cells have functional photopigments. Lacking all cone vision,
  people with rod monochromacy see the world in black, white, and grays. And
  since rods respond to dim light, people with rod monochromacy tend to be
  photophobic – very uncomfortable in bright environments.

  ### What to avoid when using colours side by side?


  Based on the types of colour blindness listed above, there are specific colour
  combinations you should avoid, especially when these colours display values
  like in charts, graphs, and maps. Green and red or light green and orange with
  similar grey values will blend into each other for people with red-green
  colour blindness when used side by side. And even when they are not side by
  side, they may lead to confusion when there are more than 4 colours in use.


  ##### Colour checking tools


  If you want to create a quick preview of your work to judge whether
  colour-blind people will have difficulties reading or understanding it, there
  are some handy tools out there. A tool we often use at JustEdo is [Color
  Oracle](http://colororacle.org/), a free colour blindness simulator for
  Windows, MacOSX and Linux. It takes the guesswork out of designing for colour
  blindness by showing you in real time what people with common colour vision
  impairments (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia) will see.


  In Figma – our favourite digital design tool – you can simulate how
  colour-blind people will see your design by running one of the [color
  blindness
  plugins](https://www.figma.com/community/search?resource_type=plugins&sort_by=relevancy&query=color+blindness&editor_type=all&price=all&creators=all)
  available. In Adobe apps like Illustrator and Photoshop, you can select a
  [proof setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiiYkJdAJUQ) for the most common
  types of colour blindness to preview your design.

  called rods and cones. The number of these vary by species and even from

### What causes colour blindness?

Colour blindness occurs when light-sensitive cells in the retina don’t respond properly to variations in wavelengths of light that enable us to see a full spectrum of colours.

[Photoreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor) in the retina are called rods and cones. Rods are more plentiful (there are approximately 100 million rods in the human retina) and they are more sensitive to light, but rods are incapable of perceiving colour.

The 6 to 7 million cones in the human retina are responsible for colour vision, and these photoreceptors are concentrated in the heart of the retina called the macula. The center of the macula is called the fovea, and this tiny (0.3 mm diameter) area contains the highest concentration of cones in the retina. It is responsible for our most acute colour vision.

Inherited forms of colour blindness often are related to deficiencies in certain types of cones or a total absence of these cones. For the vast majority of people with deficient colour vision, the condition is genetic and has been inherited from their mothers. Some people become colour-blind as a result of diseases such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis or they acquire the condition over time, due to the aging process or medications, etc.
